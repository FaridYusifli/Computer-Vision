# Computer-Vision : Single-Person 2D Joints Estimation
- This repository about the project of Computer Vision course at the Sapienza University of Rome: Single-Person 2D Joints Estimation using Convolutional Neural Network, Stacked Hourglass Network, etc.

- Here we train and test our model in 2 dataset : MPII and Unite the People dataset.
- Unfortunately I can only add here source code folder.Since the labels,datasets,results,etc folder too big or there are too much file to add here



### Neural Network: Hourglass model
### Two different datasets: MPII and Unite the People
### Comparison of model performance on the two datasets
### GPU: GTX 1080 8GB
### Training time: 30 hours per Dataset
### Keras + Tensorflow backend


More about project and the result can be found in pdf file.
