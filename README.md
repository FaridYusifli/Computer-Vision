# Computer-Vision : Single-Person 2D Joints Estimation
This is the repository about the Computer Vision course at the Sapienza University of Rome: Single-Person 2D Joints Estimation using Convolutional Neural Network, Stacked Hourglass Network, etc.

Here we train and test our model in 2 dataset : MPII and Unite the People dataset.
Here dataset is not uploaded, since it was more the 80+ GB total.


# Neural Network: Hourglass model
# Two different datasets: MPII and Unite the People
# Comparison of model performance on the two datasets
# GPU: GTX 1080 8GB
# Training time: 30 hours per Dataset
# Keras + Tensorflow backend
